# Weather_Data_Analysis-2013-2014

Purpose: 
This program reads a text file, containing weather data and converts the 
the information into a tidy dataframe suitable for analysis. It utilizes multiple functions which serve the following 
purposes: extract year, month, and day information from a combined column; rearrange the columns of a data frame; convert 
times into military time stamps; and one for the text file, designed to make necessary updates.  
Finally, the program uses the dataframes to create a series of graphs intended to answer research questions.

Necessary Tools:
The software needed to run the code is python. In particular you will need python 3 to run the code effectively. Also, the images generated must be downloaded. The files are below.

 Provenance:
The authors of this code include myself DeVon Gardner and my partner Oliver Gladfelter. Though I do not no the creator of the data set, it was given to me by my Professor, Dr. Bressoud. The data gathered from this weather data file includes many aspects of weather such as temperature, average rainfall and many others over the time frame of 2013-2014. The reason for our interest in this code is to provide insight on weather patterns and also to practice tidying data. It was used so that my partner and I could understand how real world data looks and is formated and what necessary steps we would have to take to tidy it.
 
 Issues:
One of the issues with the data itself was that it contianed many null values. So it is impossible to make a completely accurate generalization of the data when there are many values missing. These null values include the some of the different aspects of weather described above and the integers that descirbed the quantity of these aspects.
Another Issue with the code is that the index column is named measure. Though we have tried to get rid of that field name, it remains as part of the index column. It may be misleading but the column is just labeling the index value and nothing more.
