    "The weather csv file contains three distinct time variables: year, month, and day. These data are a vital part of the data and columns we intend to see in the final, tidy data set. However, munging the data set into a tidy form requires pivoting the set on a time column. To facilitate pivoting, we plan on combining the year, month, and day columns into one singular date column, on which we will pivot later on. Because we will lose the original columns in the process and be left with one column containing three different pieces of information, it is necessary to create a series of functions which can split the date column back to three columns: year, month, day. In order to accomplish this, we have created three functions, each specifically designed to extract a part of the date column. This is done simply by splitting the content within the column - a singular string in which information is seperated by hyphens - into a list, then returning one element of the resulting list. "

We resolve this by merging the year and month columns into one, accomplished by first converting the values into strings and then concating them using a hyphen to seperate the information within the string. We then melt the 31 'X1' through 'X31' columns into one column, appropriately collecting any data points that represent a day into one column, which we then name 'day.' Through this action, we have now ensured all time variables are running in the same direction. We then update the time column to include the days, so that this complete date column, titled 'year-month-day', may be used as a pivot column. Pivoting the dataframe is necessary as the 'measure' column contains several variables. We thus resolve this by pivoting the variable names within the 'measure' column into their own column headers.\n",
